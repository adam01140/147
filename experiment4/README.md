Variation in Space:
As audiences traverse this ever-changing terrain, they encounter shifts from vibrant molten reds to deep, cooling grays—each transition reflecting the natural process of lava solidifying

Variations in Key:
Every rendition of the landscape is distinct. Some worlds burst with intense, fiery reds and oranges, suggesting a state of upheaval, while others mellow into subdued grays and near-blacks, indicating calmness and resolution. 

Signs of Life:
The inevitable flow of time subtly transforms the terrain, illustrating our transient yet impactful existence within our environments.
