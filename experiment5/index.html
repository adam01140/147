				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this programming assignment, I built a generator that directly reads 1 of 3 inspiring images and then uses that image to render parameterized images </p>
				<br><p> It then adjusts its own designs to optimize an evaluation score and find the image that best fits our inspiration.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>This project integrates inspiring images that are selectable from the drop-down on the display page. </li>
                    <li>Depending on what inspiring image is selected, the program uses different types of shapes. </li>
					<li> The prgram also also varies the amount of shapes used based on each image .</li>
                    <li>The design is rendered in a way that is meant to mimic the inspiring images. </li>
					
					<li>The mutation process makes incremental changes to the inital design. </li>
					<li> The rate parameter should is implemented in a way that allows the user to almost stop exploration by sliding the rate down to 1%. </li>
					<li> The generator responds accuratly to the mutation rate slider.</li>
                </ol>

				<h2>Annealing</h2>
                <p>The most interesting results from this kind of evolutionary generator are often achieved by continually adjusting the mutation rate. Set the slider to 100%, reset the generator, and then slowly drag the slider down to 1% over the period of about 30 seconds. This allows the generator to make large design changes at the start while allowing it to focus on finely details towards the end. This is best done by hand while watching the outputs improve because you can use your human judgment to decide when the generator needs to be making bigger or smaller changes to keep making progress.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>To be honest I struggled with this assignment.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I tried my best to incorperate colors into my image generation but I couldn't get it to work no matter what I did.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I looked online through plently of documentaion but for some reason the colors always came out mono-chrome.</p>
				<br>
				<p>With that being said though, I still learned a lot throughout this project </p>
				<br>
				<p> I learned a lot about image generation and how to change the variety of shapes used and how to change the amount of shapes implemented.</p>
